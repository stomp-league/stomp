# Stomp Engine
The central stomp engine. Responsible for user management, stomp count, and leagues. Get your stomp on.

# Users
Users have names and email addresses. A user has a stomp count for each day, stomps are imported from the users chosen integration e.g. Google Health, Garmin, etc...

# Leagues
Users can create leagues and invite other users to leagues. A league must have a set period of time in which it will be run. Once the league reaches its end the user with the most stomps wins.
Users can create teams within leagues.
