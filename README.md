# Stomp
User, stomp count, and leagues.

# Users
Users have names and email addresses. A user has a stomp count for each day, stomps are imported from the user's chosen integration e.g. Google Health, Garmin, etc...

# Leagues
Users can create leagues and invite other users to leagues. A league must have a set period in which it will be run. Compete against each other or work together to reach a stomp count goal.
